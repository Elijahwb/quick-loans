                        Since 2011, Eleglance Finance has provided lending services to people who are mostly considered ‘unbankable’ by formal financial institutions. It seeks to be part of the growth of the microfinance industry in Uganda. The company upholds a dual mission of providing affordable capital to “unbankable” individuals while operating an efficient, profitable business.
